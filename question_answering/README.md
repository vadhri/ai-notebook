 A fictitious planet description in the context.txt file is fed to the model along with questions. The description and the questions ( along with answer indices ) are generated by GPT3.5.

 In the jupyter notebook, the details include loading the distill bert uncased model, fine tune it with question and answer data set with hf trainer module.
