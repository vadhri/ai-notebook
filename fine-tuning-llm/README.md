Finetuning helps to feed the domain specific, enterprise (our own data) specific, do behaviorial adjustments on the models trained. 

The process includes the following steps
1. Pretraining phase. 
    Usually already done in the case of finetuning where a model is prepared with large (possibly) crawled internet data. 
    Since the process is large, very heavy compute costs are involved. 
2. Finetuning phase.
    Make the pre-trained model to fit a chat conversation capable. 
    Make behavioral adjustments to the answers. 
    Add more data over the pre-training data.
