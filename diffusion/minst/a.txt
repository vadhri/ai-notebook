Version 1: (no names)

Roughly 8 months ago, (aside from our regular work,) we were made aware of the Quantum Computing while heading into a hackthon at Nagra India. We had some exposure while working with NIDS datasets in the process using QML techniques - while using PCA to fit the feature dimensions into number of qubits. In the process we picked up some basics of QC. 

4 weeks ago, the team (this time called positron! :)) came together again to participate in an Qhack 2024, international hackathon by Xanadu using Pennylane. Our goal was to gain exposure into pennylane and learn approach different problems using pennylane in various topics ranging from ML, Chemistry, Math, Optics, Optimization, Oracles etc. The problems were fantastically composed and gave us a very good opportunity to shape our experience.

Yay! 21/27 problems were solved at the end securing 41/708 position (~350+ active international teams) by the time the clock ran out.  

Version 2: (position yourself as learners )

Roughly 8 months ago, (aside from our regular work,) me and 2 collegues, were made aware of the Quantum Computing while heading into a hackthon at Nagra India. We had some exposure while working with NIDS datasets in the process using QML techniques - while using PCA to fit the feature dimensions into number of qubits. In the process guided by @Venkata Ratnam vadhri we picked up some basics of QC. 

4 weeks ago, Venkat assembled this team (this time called positron! :)) again to participate in an Qhack 2024, international hackathon by Xanadu using Pennylane. Our goal was to gain exposure into pennylane and learn approach different problems using pennylane in various topics ranging from ML, Chemistry, Math, Optics, Optimization, Oracles etc. The problems were fantastically composed and gave us a very good opportunity to shape our experience while the problem solving bit was handled by Venkat. 

Yay! 21/27 problems were solved at the end securing 41/708 position (~350+ active international teams) by the time the clock ran out.

Version 3: (minimal)

Yay! our team has secured 41/708 position (~350+ active international teams) by the time the clock ran out at Qhack 2024, international hackathon by Xanadu using Pennylane.
